## Overview

Welcome to STA 711! The focus of this course is statistical inference: estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. We will cover techniques for parameter estimation, properties of estimators, and testing hypotheses about unknown parameters. Throughout the course, our work will be motivated by logistic regression, which allows us to model a binomial response.

Logistic regression is an example of a *generalized linear model* (GLM), and you will continue learning about GLMs next semester in STA 712. My intention is to treat STA 711 and STA 712 as a two-course sequence, in which GLMs are used to motivate our study of statistical inference, which we ultimately apply to real models and data.

## Course materials

**Laptops:** You will need a laptop for this class, and you will sometimes need it during class. I recommend bringing your laptop each day.

**Textbook:**

* *Statistical Inference* (2nd edition), by Casella and Berger. This is classic textbook for first-year graduate statistics courses, and is an excellent, comprehensive reference. It is also full of good exercises for study and practice.

**Supplementary texts:** Here are some *optional* supplementary texts, which you may find useful as additional resources. These are *not* required for the course.

* *All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference*, by Larry Wasserman. This book is very readable and approachable.

* *Essential Statistical Inference*, by Boos and Stefanski. This book dives more deeply into some of the more advanced theory we will see in 711, particularly with multivariate random variables.

* *Generalized Linear Models with Examples in R*, by Dunn and Smyth. This book is very readable and has lots of examples and code. We will supplement the book material with additional theory in class. This is the textbook for STA 712.

* For an intuitive explanation of GLMs, with additional examples and case studies, I recommend [Beyond Multiple Linear Regression](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/), by Roback and Legler. The textbook is available, *free*, at the link provided.

**Software:** We will be using the statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), through the interface [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for working with data and statistical modeling. You will need to download R and RStudio onto your laptop.


## Getting help

If you have any questions about the course (or statistics in general!), please don't hesitate to ask! I am available during office hours, by appointment, or via email. If you're emailing about an issue with R, please include a minimum working example (everything I need to reproduce the issue you encountered). 

Keep in mind that debugging software issues can take time, so make sure to start the assignments early in case you run into problems.

**Office hours:** (Manchester 329)

## Course policies

### Communication

While course materials will be posted on the course website, I will also send messages and announcements through Canvas. Please make sure your Canvas account is set up so that you receive emails when I send these messages.

### Participation and illness

Attendance is important, and you are expected to participate actively in class and group activities and discussions. However, your health, and the health of your peers, is crucial. If you are ill, please do not come to class or office hours. All class materials will be posted online, and I can meet with you one-on-one when you have recovered. If you need office hours when you are ill, I am happy to communicate via email or Zoom. Extensions on coursework may be granted on an individual basis under extenuating circumstances.

### Extensions

You have a bank of **5** extension days, which you may use over the course of the semester. You may use either 1 or 2 extension days for a give assignment or take-home exam (making the assignment due either 24 or 48 hours after the original due date). If you plan to use an extension, you must email me before the assignment is due.

Extensions in extenuating circumstances, such as family emergencies, will be handled separately and on an individual basis.

### Accessibility

If you require accommodations due to a disability or other learning differences, contact the Center for Learning, Access, and Student Success  at 336-758-5929 or class@wfu.edu as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please feel free
to contact me, and I will be happy to discuss any necessary accommodations. I always like
to know how to help my students feel comfortable and successful in our course.

**Scent-free zone:** The 3rd floor of Manchester is a scent-free zone. Please refrain from wearing perfume, cologne, scented lotion, body spray, and all other scented products if visiting the third floor.

### Foundations for our course

In this course, we will treat one another with respect and celebrate each individual. Wake Forest is a community of individuals that seeks the enlightenment and freedom which come through diligent study and learning. An even higher goal, however, is to give life to the University motto, Pro Humanitate, as the passion for knowledge is translated into compassionate service. Wake Forest fosters compassion and caring for others. Its collective strength and character are derived from the values and distinctive experiences of each individual; therefore, the richness of human intellect and culture is affirmed in its contribution to knowledge, faith, reason, and dialogue. Furthermore, Wake Forest strives toward a society in which good will, respect, and equality prevail.

In this class, we will embrace diversity of age, background, beliefs, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, neurotype, race, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and other visible and non-visible categories. To that end, hatred, discrimination, and bigotry in any form will not be tolerated in this course. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

### Names

Names and methods of address are importance. To ensure that we address you properly, we ask that all students tell me your preferred name at the beginning of the semester, and let me know at any time if your preferred name changes. We will address one another using these preferred names during our class to make sure we are respectful of everyoneâ€™s preferences. Using the Name Coach feature in Canvas is particularly helpful to make sure we pronounce your preferred name correctly.

### Mental health

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask
for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. The University Counseling Center is here to help: call 336-758-5273 or visit their website at [https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/](https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/).

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately,
day or night:
Counseling Center: 336-758-5273

If the situation is life threatening, call the police:
911 or 336-758-5911 (campus police)

### Academic integrity

I expect and require that students conduct themselves in a manner according to the Wake Forest standard
for academic integrity. Cheating or academic dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated.
For other information on these matters, please consult the [Code of Conduct](https://static.secure.wfu.edu/files/pdf/students/judicial-handbook.pdf). For Academic issues please
see the [College Judicial System](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/the-judicial-council/).

**Sharing code and resources:**
* There are many online resources for sharing code, such as StackOverflow. Unless otherwise stated, you are free (and encouraged!) to use these resources for help on labs and assignments. However, you must **explicitly cite** where you have obtained the code (both code you used directly and code used as an inspiration). Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

* Unless otherwise stated, you are encouraged to collaborate with other students on homework assignments (not projects or exams). If you do so, please acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your assignment. Failure to acknowledge collaborators may result in a grade of 0. You may not copy code and/or answers directly from another student. If you copy someone else's work, both parties may receive a grade of 0.

* Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course!

### Professionalism

Please refrain from using your laptop, tablet, and phone for anything other than coursework during class.

## Course components

### Homework assignments

This course includes regular homework assignments to give you practice with the material and help your learning, and so I can give you feedback on your work. These problems will be graded on a Mastered / Not yet mastered scale. I will give you feedback on these questions, and you may *resubmit* each "Not yet mastered" question once. You must resubmit your work within one week of receiving feedback. 

To receive credit for an assignment, you must:

* submit the assignment by the due date (or use an extension)
* complete, *and master*, all required questions
* make a good-faith effort to answer all questions using course material

You are welcomed, and encouraged, to work with each other on homework assignments, but you must turn in
your own work. If you copy someone elseâ€™s work, both parties may receive a 0 for the assignment grade. If you work with someone else, you must write the name of your collaborator(s) on
your homework.

### Exams

There will be two take-home exams during the semester. The purpose of these exams is to demonstrate your mastery of core course material. Further instructions will be provided on each exam.

Like homework assignments, each exam question will be graded on a Mastered / Not yet mastered scale. Mastering an exam requires mastering most of the questions on that exam; specific mastery requirements will be provided on each exam. For each exam, there will be an optional take-home make-up exam (with different questions). If you do not master the exam, you may try again on the make-up exam. If you do not master the exam after taking the make-up exam, you may try again on the final exam.

Exams must be completed independently; you may not work with other students.

### Final exam

The final exam in this course is *optional*, and gives you one final opportunity to demonstrate mastery of material that you did not master on the take-home exams. The final will be a 3-hour in-person exam on **Wednesday, April 30** at **9am**.

## Grading

My goal in this course is to help you learn statistical inference, but it isn't clear that a focus on grades helps students learn; in fact, focusing on grades can detract from the learning process. I also believe that learning takes trial and error, and is not a linear process. However, we live in a world where some form of grading is necessary, so I have tried to create a grading system which de-emphasizes grades and focuses on learning. When assigning grades, I believe that

* Homework should be an opportunity to *practice* the material. It is ok to make mistakes when practicing, as long as you make an honest effort
* Errors are a good opportunity to learn and revise your work
* Partial credit and weighted averages of scores make the meaning of a grade confusing. Does an 85 in the course mean you know 85% of everything, or everything about 85% of the material?

To that end, in this course

* I will give you feedback on every assignment
* Homeworks and exams are graded as Mastered / Not yet mastered
* If you haven't yet mastered something, you get to try again!

Your final grade in the course simply reflects your work in the course and how much of the course content you have mastered. The list below shows what you need to do to receive each grade (there will be *N* homework assignments, and 2 exams).

To get a **C** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-4* homework assignments

To get a **C+** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-3* homework assignments

To get a **B-** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-3* homework assignments
* Master at least one exam

To get a **B** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-2* homework assignments
* Master at least one exam

To get a **B+** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-1* homework assignments
* Master at least one exam

To get an **A-** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-2* homework assignments
* Master at least two exams

To get an **A** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-1* homework assignments
* Master at least two exams

Each grade bundle is an indivisible unit; all assignments in a bundle must meet expectations in order to
earn the associated grade. 


## Late work

*No credit will be given for late work* (homeworks, exams, make-ups, and resubmissions), though you may extend the due date by using an extension (see above). If you know you cannot turn in assignment (for instance, if you are ill or there is a family emergency), let me know before the assignment is due, and we will work something out. There will be no grade changes
after the final exam.
