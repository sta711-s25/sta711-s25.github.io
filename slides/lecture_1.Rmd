## Motivating example: Dengue fever

**Dengue fever:** a mosquito-borne viral disease affecting 400 million people a year

## Motivating example: Dengue data

**Data:** Data on 5720 Vietnamese children, admitted to the hospital with possible dengue fever. Variables include:

* *Sex*: patient's sex (female or male)
* *Age*: patient's age (in years)
* *WBC*: white blood cell count
* *PLT*: platelet count
* other diagnostic variables...
* *Dengue*: whether the patient has dengue (0 = no, 1 = yes)


## Motivating example: Dengue data

**Research questions:**

* How well can we predict whether a patient has dengue?
* Which diagnostic measurements are most useful?
* Is there a significant relationship between WBC and dengue?


## Research questions

* How well can we predict whether a patient has dengue?
* Which diagnostic measurements are most useful?
* Is there a significant relationship between WBC and dengue?

How can I answer each of these questions? Discuss with a neighbor for 2 minutes, then we will discuss as a class.

## Fitting a model: initial attempt

What if we try a linear regression model?

$$Y_i = \text{dengue status of } i\text{th  patient}$$

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i + \varepsilon_i \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$$

What are some potential issues with this linear regression model?

## Second attempt

Let's rewrite the linear regression model:

\vspace{5cm}


## Second attempt

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i) \hspace{1cm} p_i = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i)$$

$$p_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i$$

Are there still any potential issues with this approach?

## Don't fit linear regression with a binary response

```{r setup, echo=F, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, fig.align='center', message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
dengue <- read.csv("https://sta279-s22.github.io/labs/dengue.csv")

dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = WBC, y = Dengue)) +
  #geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F) +
  theme_bw() #+
  #theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```


## Fixing the issue: logistic regression

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$g(p_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i$$

where $g: (0, 1) \to \mathbb{R}$ is unbounded.

**Usual choice:** $g(p_i) = \log \left( \dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right)$

\vspace{4cm}


## Odds

**Definition:** If $p_i = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i)$, the **odds** are $\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$

**Example:** Suppose that $\mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i) = 0.8$. What are the *odds* that the patient has dengue?


\vspace{3cm}

## Odds

**Definition:** If $p_i = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i)$, the **odds** are $\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$

The probabilities $p_i \in [0, 1]$. The linear function $\beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i \in (-\infty, \infty)$. What range of values can $\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$ take?

\vspace{3cm}

## Log odds

$$g(p_i) = \log \left(\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right)$$

\vspace{4cm}

## Binary logistic regression

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$\log \left(\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i$$

**Note:** Can generalize to $Y_i \sim Binomial(m_i, p_i)$, but we won't do that yet.

## Example: simple logistic regression

$$Y_i = \text{dengue status (0 = no, 1 = yes)} \hspace{1cm} Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\widehat{p}_i}{1 - \widehat{p}_i}\right) = 1.737 - 0.361 \ WBC_i$$

Work in groups of 2-3 for 5 minutes on the following questions:

* Are patients with a higher WBC more or less likely to have dengue?
* Interpret the estimated slope in context of a unit change in the log odds.
* What is the change in *odds* asociated with a unit increase in WBC?
