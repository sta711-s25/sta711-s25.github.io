## Recall: Newton's method

## Newton's method for logistic regression

## Example

Suppose that $\log \left( \dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i}$, and we have

$$\beta^{(r)} = \begin{bmatrix} -3.1 \\ 0.9 \end{bmatrix}, \hspace{1cm} U(\beta^{(r)}) = \begin{bmatrix} 9.16 \\ 31.91 \end{bmatrix},$$
$${\bf H}(\beta^{(r)}) = -\begin{bmatrix} 17.834 & 53.218 \\ 53.218 & 180.718 \end{bmatrix}$$

Use Newton's method to calculate $\beta^{(r + 1)}$ (you may use R or a calculator, you do not need to do the matrix arithmetic by hand).
