# Exploring Wald and likelihood ratio tests

The purpose of this class activity is to compare the Wald and likelihood ratio test statistics, and their asymptotic distributions.

For this class assignment, suppose we observe data $(X_1, Y_1), ..., (X_n, Y_n)$, where 
$$X_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, 1)$$
$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$
$$\log \left( \frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$$

We wish to test the hypotheses $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ vs. $H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$. Since this is a two-sided test the Wald statistic for these hypotheses can either be written 

$$Z = \frac{\widehat{\beta}_1 - 0}{SD(\widehat{\beta}_1)}$$
or

$$W = \frac{(\widehat{\beta}_1 - 0)^2}{Var(\widehat{\beta}_1)}$$
and the likelihood ratio test statistic is
$$G = 2 \ell(\widehat{\beta}_{full}) - 2 \ell(\widehat{\beta}_{reduced})$$

## Questions

Use the code below to generate data from the model with $\beta_0 = 0.5$, $\beta_1 = 0$, and $n = 100$:

```{r, eval=F}
n <- 100
beta0 <- 0.5
beta1 <- 0
x <- rnorm(n)
p <- exp(beta0 + beta1 * x)/(1 + exp(beta0 + beta1 * x))
y <- rbinom(n, 1, p)
```

1. Calculate the Wald statistic and the likelihood ratio statistic on the simulated data. Repeat many times, and confirm with simulations that $W \approx \chi^2_1$ and $G \approx \chi^2_1$ under $H_0$.

2. Show in simulations that the distributions of $W$ and $G$ get closer to the $\chi^2_1$ distribution as $n \to \infty$ (under $H_0$).

3. Plot $W$ against $G$ when $H_0$ is true. How does the relationship between the Wald and LRT statistic change as $n \to \infty$ (when $H_0$ is true)?

4. Now modify the simulations with $n = 100$ and $\beta_1 = 0.5$. How do the distributions of the test statistics change for the new value of $\beta_1$?

5. With $\beta_1 = 0.5$ and $n = 100$, estimate $\mathbb{E}(W)$. How does $\mathbb{E}(W)$ change as you change $n$?
