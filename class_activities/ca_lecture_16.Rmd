# Hypothesis testing with the Titanic data

In this class activity, we will construct confidence intervals for quantities of interest in the titanic data. Let $Y_i$ denote whether passenger $i$ survived. We will use the model

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$\log \left( \dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Sex_i + \beta_2 Age_i + \beta_3 SecondClass_i + \beta_4 ThirdClass_i$$

The Titanic data can be imported into R with

```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("https://sta711-s25.github.io/homework/Titanic.csv")
```


## Questions

1. Fit the logistic regression model in R.

2. Use a Wald test to test 

$$H_0: \beta_3 = \beta_4 = 0 \hspace{1cm} H_A: \text{at least one of } \beta_3, \beta_4 \neq 0$$

Recall that the variance-covariance matrix can be extracted with the `vcov(...)` function.
